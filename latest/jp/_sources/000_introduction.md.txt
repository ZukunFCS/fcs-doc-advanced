# Introduction
This website hosts more advanced topics for FCS, including more detailed explanation of new features, benchmark result and more.  
We will be editing this as new features get released. 

### What is FCS and what does it do for me?
FCS is a piece of software for facial animator to create facial animation for their own rig given video footage of actor (usually of a head mounted-camera).
If you wish to learn how to use FCS, we have a separate full length online manual in English and Japanese [here](https://zukunfcs.github.io/fcs-doc). This page is, however, currently only available in English. 

### Who is this page for?
This page is for (potential) users who are evaluating FCS or are looking for hints to elevate their animation speed and quality. 
Here we provide you an easier way to understand the quality of animation that they can and cannot expect from FCS, and the associated effort (artist time) required to achieve the level of quality you require. Evaluating a new piece of software takes time, and we are here to make it slightly easier.
